# Assimilate - an AfriHacks 2023 hack

Assimilate is an attempt to solve the fundamental problem of "too many eager students, not enough willing teachers". Society has progressed rapidly on many fronts, but education is one of the areas that has been left behind in this digital age. Teachers have to contend with children distracted by digital devices, and are unable to cope with growing workloads and [classroom counts](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.ENRL.TC.ZS?locations=NG). 

We want to try and make teachers' lives easier, while simultaneously giving each child well-needed attention. We utilise cutting-edge Generative AI models such as GPT-4, which allow interactiosn with students to encompass text, audio and other forms of media. We also make use of Anthropic's Claude 2.1 which has first-class support for tokenising [large sequences of text](www.anthropic.com/index/claude-2-1) -- making it invaluable to analysing student textbooks, info sheets, and more.

Assimilate plans to partner with schools and other educational institutions in order to provide an even more immersive experience for the student, by automatically surfacing local information that is relevant to the current conversation, such as current school sporting events, upcoming tests & assignments, as well as fun activites their classmates may be engaging in.
